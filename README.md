# Calculator Project

This project is being made in order to demonstrate what I have learnt in the odin project's foundations course. I put in practice my skills on HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to make a calculator which will be deployed in github pages.

Finally, this proyect is going to be made using git branches in order to work with version control.
